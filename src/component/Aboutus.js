The Plant List is a working list of all known types of plants. It is supposed to include species of vascular plants (flowering plants, conifers, ferns and their allies) and algal plants (algae and liverwort).
Collaboration between the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden enabled the creation of a botanical list by combining multiple checklist data sets maintained by these institutions and other collaborators.
The list of plants provides the accepted Latin name for most species.
Below is a description of the plant, its type, season and appropriate time to plant it.
